<h2 id="AboutUs">About Us</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is no secret that science governs the very essence of life. From the streets we walk on to the nature that surrounds us, many intricate principles are ever-present in the world we live in. As such, Innovative Minds is dedicated to bringing all things science and environment to the students of Asia Pacific University. What began as a club of 4 members has now grown into the prestigious community of like-minded science enthusiast whose effort to provide quality content is well-knwon among the students and faculty alike. Throughout the years, we have established many connections with other parties on and off campus. The fruits of our labour have allowed us to gradually organise more events for the public in hopes of cultivating intellectual minds, further progressing the the nation's growth in challenging environments. In addition to science, we are also environmental activists and therefore conduct charity events to safeguard Mother Nature as well.</p>
